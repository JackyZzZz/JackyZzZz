I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/). I worked as an undergraduate researcher at the [Information Systems Group](https://isg.ics.uci.edu/), a software developer at [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2024, and a teaching assistant for various intro to intermediate Python courses taught at UC Irvine. My main research interests are in the fields of back-end development and distributed systems.

Fast and eager learner, able to produce substantial and disciplined solutions using programming languages and technologies that are learned along the way.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been involved in various projects, including [Texera](https://github.com/Texera/texera), a collaborative data analytics platform supporting over 4,000 users worldwide, and the development of the Global Airport App, a Python-based GUI application that parses and manages information on over 75,880 airports. I also created a [Breakout game](https://github.com/JackyZzZz/BREAKOUT-GAME) with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript that supports real-time responsive scoring.
