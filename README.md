My technical expertise spans a variety of languages and technologies, including Python, Java, C++, and front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, complemented by my proficiency in frameworks such as React and tools like Docker and Kubernetes. I have applied these skills in diverse projects, from developing a collaborative data analytics platform to creating an efficient TA-Class Matching System, showcasing my ability to address real-world problems with innovative solutions.

With a keen interest in both the theoretical and practical aspects of software engineering, I am continuously exploring new technologies and methodologies. I am enthusiastic about the ongoing learning process inherent in the field of computer science and am committed to developing solutions that are not only technically sound but also meet real business needs.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been involved in various projects, including [Texera](https://github.com/Texera/texera), a collaborative data analytics platform supporting over 4,000 users worldwide, and the development of the Global Airport App, a Python-based GUI application that parses and manages information on over 75,880 airports. I also created a [Breakout game](https://github.com/JackyZzZz/BREAKOUT-GAME) with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript that supports real-time responsive scoring.
