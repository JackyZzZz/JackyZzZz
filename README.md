### Hi there! I am Jun, a 3rd-year CS student @ UC Irvine

I have a firm grounding in ***Python***, R, finance, and statistics. Beyond academics, I embrace opportunities to help others navigate the university experience, whether that's leading campus tours or providing mentorship to undeclared students. I'm passionate about learning and regularly engage in online courses to further expand my skill set during my free time, such as ***C++ and Java***. I enjoy the challenge of leadership as well, serving as President of the Career Development Department in our Student Union. I'm fluent in both English and Mandarin and in my spare time, I can be found keeping fit, gaming, or capturing life through a lens~
