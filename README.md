I am Jun Xia, a highly motivated and skilled computer science professional with a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of California, Irvine. As a Software Engineer Intern at UC Irvine, I have developed a variety of data management and text analytics projects under the supervision of [Prof. Chen Li](https://chenli.ics.uci.edu/). I also served as an ICS Learning Assistant, helping intermediate Python students develop a strong conceptual understanding of the subject.



I am proficient in multiple programming languages, including Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Scala. I am also experienced with technologies such as Git, Bash, React, and API development. My diverse skill set, strong work ethic, and passion for computer science make me a valuable asset to any team. Connect with me to learn more about my background and experiences~
